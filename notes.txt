trunk-based development. commits on branches are always played OVER the last commits on the oringal branch. can branch out multiple layers.

trunk

--dev

  -- graham/wow



totally module based. can use node.js and fork mutliple children in a way to utilize multiple cores so diffs don't take for freaking ever.
